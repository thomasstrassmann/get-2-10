### Skeleton 
To get a visual idea of the already mentioned content, a blueprint or wireframe model was made. There are corresponding wireframe models for each HTML page. For the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned here that the wireframes are not binding and ideas and conceptions of the website may change during the development phase.

You can click [here](./assets/wireframes/) to take a look at the wireframes.

### Surface

The color palette considered is composed of an orange tone of the bass from the hero image, with the application of other compound colors. Adobe's Color Wheel was used for this purpose. The colors are also located in the link above. 

Google Fonts was used for the typography. The font ... is used for important texts and headlines, the font ... is used for descriptive paragraphs. For the icons in the footer, the fontawesome page was a reliable source.

A website logo was created with the Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Express to be exact. The website logo is also part of the [](./assets/).

## Testing 

The page and its functionality was tested manually. This was done primarily using Chrome DevTools (Lighthouse), as well as the website http://www.responsinator.com/. These were especially helpful to check layout, design and structure. 

Furthermore, the W3C Validator (jigsaw) was used to ensure that all HTML pages and the CSS file are valid. Hardly any errors were found. 

To test accessibility and SEO, Lighthouse was used.
